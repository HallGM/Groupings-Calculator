# Groupings-Calculator

This project was created in collaboration with the Extinction Rebellion Glasgow. Workshop participants are placed into groups based on answers provided to a survey. The Groupings Calculator takes in a list of 8 or more participants who have answered three questions with numerical answers from 1 to 10. It then places them into groups where people with the most similar answers are grouped together.
